# CS1 in Java
A collection of OER Components for building a Java-based CS1 Textbook with a focus on the small things

The content in this repository has evolved from a lab manual used to teach Java using JShell (see the commit history for this material) but is now being updated primarily to develop OER for CM111 (CS1) at Washburn University with the intent to produce reusable OER components for a variety of pedagogical purposes. There will still be a focus on statements and expressions and the goal is still to integrade code cafe (a work in progress for interctive Java exercises in the book). Collaborators welcome. See the Issues tab to see where I'm at.
